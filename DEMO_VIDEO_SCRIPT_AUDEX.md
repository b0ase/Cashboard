# 90‑Second Demo Video Script – AUDEX on Cashboard

## Concept
- AUDEX: a faceless YouTube channel (AI‑First Record Label) publishing AI‑generated music videos
- Revenue: YouTube ads revenue flows in; Cashboard splits and pays dividends to token holders automatically
- Market dynamic: Tracks with higher ad revenue pay bigger dividends; royalty share price trades higher

## Visual Style
- Fast, glossy UI captures, dark theme, glitch/lofi aesthetics
- Motion graphics for money flow, cap table, and dividend particles
- Minimal on‑screen text; crisp VO; energetic electronic soundtrack

## Script With Timing

0:00–0:05
- Visual: AUDEX logo pulse on black; waveform animates
- VO: “Meet AUDEX — a faceless, AI‑first record label.”
- On‑screen text: AUDEX — AI‑First Record Label

0:05–0:15
- Visual: Montage of AI‑generated music clips + YouTube channel grid
- VO: “We publish AI‑generated music videos. Ads revenue comes in. Token holders get paid — automatically.”
- On‑screen text: Ads in → Dividends out

0:15–0:25
- Visual: Cashboard UI — create organization
- Actions: New Organization → Name: AUDEX → Token Symbol: AUDEX → Create
- VO: “In Cashboard, we start from the business: create the AUDEX organization and its token.”
- On‑screen text: Organization‑centric automation

0:25–0:40
- Visual: Members & Shares view; add roles (Founder, Producer, Community) with allocations; cap table appears
- Insert: Track cards (Track A, Track B…) with ‘Buy royalty shares’ badges
- VO: “Define roles and share allocations. Fans buy royalty shares in tracks they love.”
- On‑screen text: Cap‑table aware dividends

0:40–0:55
- Visual: Canvas view — natural language bar
- User types: “When YouTube AdSense revenue arrives, split 70% to Royalty Pool, 20% Ops, 10% Reserve. Distribute the Royalty Pool to track token holders pro‑rata weekly. Pause if runway < 6 months.”
- Nodes appear: Payment → Split → Royalty Pool → Dividend → Guardrail (Runway) → Exceptions
- VO: “Describe the business logic in plain English. Cashboard builds the flow.”
- On‑screen text: AI‑built flows; Guardrails & policy

0:55–1:10
- Visual: Live animation (like the demo modal). ‘Ad Revenue In’ pulses; particles flow to Revenue → Split branches; Dividend particles burst to holders; balances tick up.
- Sidebar stats: Total Revenue; Dividends Distributed; Top Tracks leaderboard with price change arrows.
- VO: “As ads revenue hits, payouts route in real time. Top‑earning tracks pay larger dividends — their royalty share price rises.”
- On‑screen text: Real‑time payouts; Price reflects earnings

1:10–1:20
- Visual: Contract panel for ‘Royalty Policy’ shows human‑readable text + machine‑readable schema (clauses, KPIs, triggers)
- VO: “Contracts are human‑readable and machine‑readable. Clauses become triggers that run.”
- On‑screen text: Contracts that execute

 Example snippet (overlay):
 ```json
 {
   "title": "AUDEX Royalty Policy",
   "allocations": { "royaltyPool": 70, "ops": 20, "reserve": 10 },
   "distribution": { "schedule": "weekly", "dayOfWeek": "mon", "time": "09:00", "timezone": "UTC" },
   "proRataBasis": { "method": "snapshot", "snapshot": { "frequency": "daily", "windowDays": 7 } },
   "guardrails": { "minRunwayMonths": 6, "onBreach": "pause_payouts" },
   "triggers": [ { "event": "revenue_received", "action": "distribute_royalties" } ]
 }
 ```

1:20–1:25
- Visual: Audit trail and policy checks passing; exception route example (failed payment re‑try)
- VO: “Every step is auditable, with guardrails.”
- On‑screen text: Audit & idempotency

1:25–1:30
- Visual: AUDEX logo + Cashboard logo; CTA button
- VO: “This is AUDEX on Cashboard. Design how money moves — then let AI run it.”
- On‑screen text/CTA: Join the waitlist → Cashboard | AUDEX

## On‑Screen Text (Roll‑ups)
- Organization‑centric automation
- Cap‑table aware dividends
- AI‑built flows; Guardrails & policy
- Real‑time payouts; Price reflects earnings
- Contracts that execute
- Audit & idempotency

## Assets To Capture
- Cashboard: Create Organization (AUDEX) flow
- Members & Shares (cap table) with token symbol
- Canvas: prompt → nodes (Payment, Split, Dividend, Guardrail, Exceptions)
- Live payout animation (adapt current demo modal text/labels)
- Contract panel mock: human text + JSON schema snippet
- Leaderboard mock: Track cards with price change arrows

## Music & SFX
- Upbeat electronic instrumental (non‑vocal) at ~120–130 BPM
- Subtle UI click/woosh SFX on node creation and payout bursts

## Optional Alt Endings (5–10s)
- Split‑screen: Traditional spreadsheet chaos vs. Cashboard flow clarity
- Price chart flare on top track as dividend ticks land

## Notes For Editor
- Keep text minimal; let visuals read the logic
- Use color‑coding: Money (green), Royalty Pool (purple), Guardrails (blue), Exceptions (amber)
- Favor 2–3 second shots; match cuts on beat
