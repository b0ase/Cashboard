# Cashboard – Marketing Strategy & Social Copy

## 1) Positioning & Narrative

- Core positioning: “AI‑assisted business operations platform.” A level above generic automation (e.g., n8n): start from the organization (roles, contracts, shares, money) and compose integrations around it.
- One‑line: “Design how money and work move through your business—then let AI run it.”
- Differentiators:
  - Organization‑centric model (roles, shares, policies) vs. app‑centric integrations
  - Native money flows and dividend distribution; cap‑table aware
  - AI‑drafted contracts that are human‑readable and machine‑readable
  - Canvas with business‑native nodes (Payments, Contracts, Dividends, Teams, Milestones)

## 2) Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs)

- Startup founders/COOs/CFOs who need revenue sharing, role management, and automation without heavy ops teams
- Agencies/Studios distributing income to collaborators and shareholders
- Product teams exploring AI + automation to codify business logic
- Web3‑curious companies who want tokenized equity and real‑time dividends (without crypto complexity upfront)

## 3) Messaging Pillars

- Money Flow Clarity: Visualize revenue, costs, and payouts end‑to‑end
- Operate by Policy: Role‑based permissions, audit trails, and guardrails
- AI‑First Ops: Describe the business in natural language; get flows and contracts
- Composable Instruments: Revenue splits, vesting schedules, milestone escrows, dividend policies

## 4) Value Propositions

- Reduce operational toil: codify routine payouts and handoffs
- Make revenue sharing automatic, transparent, and auditable
- Close the loop from contract → task → milestone → payment
- Build once, scale with AI and templates

## 5) Competitive Landscape

- n8n/Zapier/Make: great at integrations; Cashboard is organization/money native
- Notion/Airtable: great databases/docs; Cashboard is executable operations
- Web3 tools: focus on on‑chain; Cashboard blends pragmatic off‑chain ops with optional tokenization

## 6) Go‑To‑Market Plan

- Phase 1: Tease & Waitlist (2–3 weeks)
  - Short demo video of real‑time revenue → dividend flow (current demo modal)
  - Tweets/LinkedIn posts + landing page with clear positioning
  - Collect use cases on waitlist form (org size, payout frequency, tools)

- Phase 2: Design Partner Beta (6–8 weeks)
  - 10–15 teams (agencies/startups) with biweekly feedback calls
  - Build the high‑leverage features: flow persistence, policy hooks, payouts API, contracts schema

- Phase 3: Public Beta + PH/Community Launch
  - Product Hunt, founder/ops communities, AI + automation newsletters
  - Case study posts; live stream of “build my company ops in 60 minutes”

- Phase 4: Scale & Integrations
  - Expand adaptors (billing, identity, data), premium templates, enterprise controls

## 7) Channels & Tactics

- Social: X/Twitter (dev + founders), LinkedIn (ops/finance), YouTube (demos)
- Communities: Product Hunt, Indie Hackers, r/startups, niche founder Slacks/Discords
- Content:
  - Explainers: “Machine‑readable contracts: a practical guide”
  - Tutorials: “Revenue splits and dividends in 10 minutes”
  - Comparisons: “Beyond n8n: organization‑centric automation”
- SEO targets:
  - business workflow automation, AI workflow builder, revenue sharing software, dividend distribution platform, tokenized equity management, real‑time payouts

## 8) Pricing & Packaging (draft)

- Free: Explore canvas, 1 org, 5 nodes, manual dividends
- Pro: Unlimited flows/orgs, policy hooks, payout automation, templates
- Enterprise: SSO, advanced permissions, SLAs, custom integrations

## 9) Launch Assets Checklist

- 90‑second demo video (landing + socials)
- Screenshots: Dashboard, Cash Handles, Organizations, Dividends, Canvas mock
- One‑pager PDF for stakeholder buy‑in
- Case study blog (agency scenario)

## 10) KPIs

- Waitlist signups → beta acceptance rate
- Activated organizations (created org + first dividend flow)
- Time‑to‑first payout/automation
- Weekly active orgs; flows/run counts; retained 4‑week cohorts

# Social Copy

## Short Tweets (ideas)

1) Cashboard = org‑centric automation. Start with roles, contracts, shares… then compose the integrations. AI drafts the flows. You hit run.
2) Most tools automate apps. We automate the business: money flows, policies, and dividends—on one canvas.
3) Real‑time revenue → pro‑rata dividends. Cap‑table aware. Human‑readable contracts with machine‑readable metadata.
4) “Split 30% of weekly revenue across the marketing team, then pay shareholders monthly.” Say it → get a runnable flow.
5) Contracts that do something. Clauses and KPIs become triggers for tasks, milestones, and payouts.
6) Build your operating system: Payments, Contracts, Teams, Milestones—nodes that fit together like lego.
7) From Notion docs to executable operations. Cashboard turns business logic into runs, audits, and payouts.
8) If n8n/Zapier is the toolbox, Cashboard is the shop floor. Design how work and money actually move.
9) Automate revenue sharing without spreadsheets. Visualize, simulate, and ship payouts with guardrails.
10) We’re building an AI‑assisted ops canvas for founders and COOs. Want early access? (DM or join waitlist)

## Tweet Threads (2 examples)

Thread A: Org‑centric automation
- 1/ We’ve all used tools that automate app‑to‑app tasks. Helpful—but businesses run on people, roles, contracts, and money.
- 2/ Cashboard flips the model: start from the organization. Roles, policies, cap table, and money flows are first‑class.
- 3/ The canvas has business‑native nodes: Payments, Contracts, Dividends, Teams, Milestones.
- 4/ Contracts are human‑readable and machine‑readable. Clauses and KPIs become triggers.
- 5/ “Split revenue by %; pause if runway < 6 months; pay dividends monthly.” Say it → get a flow.
- 6/ You get audit trails, guardrails, and idempotent execution. The boring ops become reliable.
- 7/ If you’re a founder/COO and this clicks, we’re inviting design partners. Join the waitlist.

Thread B: Money flows → dividends
- 1/ Revenue comes in. Who gets what, when, and why? That logic lives across spreadsheets, Slack, and someone’s head.
- 2/ Cashboard makes money flow visible. Track, split, and automate payouts across roles and shareholders.
- 3/ Cap‑table aware dividends, milestone‑based escrows, vesting schedules—compose them like lego blocks.
- 4/ Simulate, then run. See the audit trail. Route exceptions by policy.
- 5/ Want a demo? We built a live animation to show revenue → pro‑rata dividends in real time. DM for access.

## LinkedIn Post (short)

We’re building Cashboard: an AI‑assisted business operations platform.

Rather than automating apps, we model the organization—roles, contracts, shares—and let you design how money and work move across it. AI drafts flows and contracts. You run with guardrails and an audit trail.

If you lead ops/finance or run an agency/startup that shares revenue, we’re opening a design partner program. Comment “invite” and we’ll reach out.
