# Workflow Export/Import System

This document describes the new workflow export/import functionality added to Cashboard, allowing users to save and restore complete workflow states with all node positions, connections, and settings.

## Features

### Export Functionality
- **Export Button**: Located in the workflow canvas controls panel (top-right)
- **Complete Workflow State**: Exports all nodes, edges, positions, and canvas settings
- **Metadata Preservation**: Includes workflow name, description, version, and export timestamp
- **Canvas Settings**: Preserves viewport position, zoom level, and connection styles
- **File Format**: JSON format with descriptive filename

### Import Functionality
- **Import Button**: Available in both the Workflow Dashboard and individual workflow canvases
- **Dashboard Import**: Adds imported workflows to the workflow library
- **Canvas Import**: Directly loads workflows into the current canvas
- **Format Support**: Handles both Cashboard exports and generic workflow formats
- **Smart Import**: Automatically detects export format and applies appropriate import logic

## Usage

### Exporting a Workflow

1. **Open a workflow canvas** in Cashboard
2. **Locate the export button** (ðŸ“¤ Export) in the top-right controls panel
3. **Click the export button** to download the workflow as a JSON file
4. **File naming**: Automatically generates descriptive filenames (e.g., `MyWorkflow_workflow_2024-01-20.json`)

### Importing a Workflow

#### Option 1: Import to Dashboard
1. **Navigate to the Workflow Dashboard**
2. **Click the Import button** (ðŸ“¥ Import) in the header section
3. **Select a JSON file** exported from Cashboard or compatible workflow tool
4. **Workflow is added** to your workflow library with full metadata

#### Option 2: Import to Canvas
1. **Open any workflow canvas**
2. **Click the Import button** (ðŸ“¥ Import) in the controls panel
3. **Select a JSON file** to import
4. **Workflow is loaded** directly into the current canvas with preserved positioning

## Export File Structure

The exported JSON file contains the following structure:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "Workflow Name",
    "description": "Workflow description",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "exportedAt": "2024-01-20T12:00:00.000Z",
    "author": "Cashboard User",
    "type": "workflow_export",
    "canvasInfo": {
      "totalNodes": 5,
      "totalEdges": 4,
      "canvasScale": 100,
      "isRunning": false,
      "autoMode": false
    }
  },
  "workflow": {
    "nodes": [
      {
        "id": "node1",
        "position": { "x": 100, "y": 100 },
        "data": { "label": "Node Label", "kind": "workflow" },
        "type": "colored"
      }
    ],
    "edges": [
      {
        "id": "edge1",
        "source": "node1",
        "target": "node2",
        "type": "default"
      }
    ],
    "viewport": {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "zoom": 1
    },
    "settings": {
      "connectionStyle": "straight",
      "gridSnap": true,
      "showGrid": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Import Compatibility

### Cashboard Exports
- **Full compatibility** with all features preserved
- **Automatic detection** of export format
- **Complete restoration** of workflow state
- **Settings preservation** including viewport and connection styles

### Generic Workflow Formats
- **Basic compatibility** with standard workflow structures
- **Automatic ID generation** for imported elements
- **Position randomization** if coordinates are missing
- **Flexible edge mapping** (supports both `source/target` and `from/to`)

## Benefits

1. **Workflow Backup**: Save important workflows for safekeeping
2. **Collaboration**: Share workflows with team members
3. **Version Control**: Track workflow evolution over time
4. **Template Library**: Build a collection of reusable workflow patterns
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Restore workflows after system issues
6. **Cross-Platform**: Move workflows between different Cashboard instances

## Technical Details

### Export Process
- Captures current React Flow state
- Serializes all node and edge data
- Preserves canvas viewport and settings
- Generates timestamped metadata
- Creates downloadable JSON blob

### Import Process
- Validates JSON file structure
- Detects export format automatically
- Maps imported data to React Flow format
- Handles ID conflicts gracefully
- Restores canvas state completely

### Error Handling
- **File Format Validation**: Ensures JSON structure is correct
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Validates required fields are present
- **User Feedback**: Clear success/error messages with details
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handles missing or invalid data gracefully

## Example Use Cases

1. **Backup Current Work**: Export before making major changes
2. **Share with Team**: Export and send to colleagues
3. **Template Creation**: Export successful workflows as templates
4. **Archiving**: Save completed workflows for future reference
5. **Migration**: Move workflows between different environments
6. **Documentation**: Export workflows for documentation purposes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Import Fails with "Invalid Format" Error**
- Ensure the file is a valid JSON file
- Check that the file was exported from Cashboard
- Verify the file structure matches the expected format

**Nodes Import but Connections Don't**
- Check that edge source/target IDs match node IDs
- Ensure the JSON file contains both nodes and edges arrays

**Canvas Viewport Not Restored**
- Verify the export file contains viewport data
- Check that the viewport object has x, y, and zoom properties

**Import Adds Duplicate Elements**
- Clear the canvas before importing if you want a clean import
- Use the import to add to existing workflows rather than replace

### Best Practices

1. **Regular Exports**: Export workflows periodically as backups
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful workflow names for easier identification
3. **Version Control**: Include version numbers in workflow names
4. **Testing Imports**: Test import functionality with sample workflows
5. **File Organization**: Organize exported files in a dedicated folder

## Future Enhancements

- **Batch Import/Export**: Handle multiple workflows at once
- **Cloud Storage**: Direct integration with cloud storage services
- **Version History**: Track changes between exports
- **Collaborative Editing**: Real-time workflow sharing
- **Format Conversion**: Support for additional workflow formats
- **Template Marketplace**: Share and discover workflow templates
