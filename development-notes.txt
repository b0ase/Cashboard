We want 'expandable nodes' so that when we click on (for example) the Dev Team node that says it has three members, we want the node to expand to show us nodes for each member too. We also want to be able to plug into CRM and CMS systems and Spreadsheets. We also want google OAuth to create user acounts, and Stripe integration to offer subscription options to users (just like n8n).
